# Meme Generator
Welcome to Meme Generator! Meme Generator allows a user to choose a meme template, fill in the meme with text, and then download the meme. Extra features have been implemented for this project, such as manually resizing the text and moving the text on the meme images. Meme Generator was a mod 4 project by three students at Flatiron School and is still being slowly worked upon. Look out for future updates!

Want to make your own memes? Clone this repo, cd into the correct directory, and run `npm i && npm start` to get started!

Stretch goals for this project include:
- Allowing users to add more text boxes to a meme
- Allowing users to have their own collection of memes they've created
- Implementing user authentication
- Accepting memes from the api that are known to have more than two text box areas
